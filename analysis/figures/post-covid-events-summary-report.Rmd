# Summary

This is a brief report generated using markdown to provide a summary of results from post-covid-events analyses performed in OpenSAFELY. 

\newpage

# Table 1

## Number of patients analysed in OpenSAFELY, and the numbers of people who were exposed to COVID-19 and those who were and were not hospitalised within 28 days of diagnosis of COVID-19.

```{r T1, out.width="100%"}
table1 <- read.csv(paste0(results_dir,"Table1_",outcome,".csv"))
pander::pander(table1, split.cell = 10, split.table = Inf)
```

\newpage

# Table 2

## Numbers of events in OpenSAFELY before and after diagnosis of COVID-19.

```{r T2, out.width="100%"}
table2 <- read.csv(paste0(results_dir,"table2_",outcome,".csv"))
# remove "_" to tidy up a little
table2 <- data.frame(lapply(table2, function(x) {
          gsub("_", " ", x)
              }))
colnames(table2) = gsub("_", " ", colnames(table2))
pander::pander(table2, split.cells = 8)
```

\newpage

# Venn Diagrams

```{r figSvg,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
for(i in venn_prefixs){
fig_svg <- cowplot::ggdraw()+cowplot::draw_image(paste0(results_dir,"venn_diagram_",outcome,"_",i,".svg"))
plot(fig_svg)
}
```

# Figure 1

## Age/sex/region adjusted and maximally adjusted hazard ratios (log scale) for different events by time since diagnosis of COVID-19.

```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis', out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(results_dir,"Figure1_unvaccinated_",outcome,".png"))
```

\newpage

# Figure 2

## Hazard ratios (log scale) for event after COVID-19 stratified by subgroups (N.B. subgroups included will depend on outcome and number of events).

```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis', out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(results_dir,"figure2_COVID_phenotype_unvaccinated_",outcome,".png"))
```

\newpage

# Diabetes flow chart

## Flow chart showing the assignment of diabetes cases using the diabetes algorithm. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
show_flow <- ifelse(outcome=="diabetes", TRUE, FALSE)
```

```{r conditional_block, eval=show_flow, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(results_dir,"diabetes_flow_",outcome,".png"))
```
